This bot has three main functionalities.

1. It can update a list of people who subscribed using `!follow` about how many days remain until Overwatch 2. It is already out, so this feature is not as relevant anymore.

2. It can send a message to a specific discord channel, regarding whether a user is listed as online on a specific server. This is a generally userful functionality.

3. When someone types `!when` in a server channel that this bot operates in, the bot will respond with the time until Overwatch 2 releases. Since the game is already out, the bot will respond that the user should go play the game.

The original followObject.json file is not included because it contains specific user ID's. Of course, nodemon and .env are also excluded.
